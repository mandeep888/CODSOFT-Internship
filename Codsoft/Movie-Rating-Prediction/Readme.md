Title: Movie Rating Prediction Using Python

Abstract:
This project aims to develop a model that predicts movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. By analyzing historical movie data, the goal is to create a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by either users or critics. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to gain insights into the factors affecting movie ratings.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about movies, including features such as:

- Genre: Genre(s) of the movie
- Director: Director(s) of the movie
- Actors: Main actors in the movie
- Rating: Rating given to the movie
- Other features: Additional attributes like year, duration, etc.

Methodology:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset containing movie information.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform necessary feature scaling.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze feature distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
5. Model Building: Utilize regression techniques to build a model predicting movie ratings based on provided features.
6. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
7. Visualization: Visualize predicted vs. actual ratings and other relevant insights from the data.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
