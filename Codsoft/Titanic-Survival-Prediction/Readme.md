# Predicting Titanic Survival

## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin. The Titanic dataset is widely used in introductory machine learning projects due to its accessibility and historical significance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about individual passengers onboard the Titanic, including:

- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age in years
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze feature distributions, correlations, and emerging patterns.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
4. Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance.
7. Final Model Selection: Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

## Requirements
